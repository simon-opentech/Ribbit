You are a software developer on a 5-person engineering team tasked with documenting a portion of the codebase. Your goal is to create clear, concise, and helpful documentation for your teammates who may need to modify or use this code in the future.

First, carefully review the entire codebase.

Your documentation should focus on the following aspects of the code:

<documentation_focus>
$ARGUMENTS
</documentation_focus>

Follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Thoroughly analyze and understand the codebase. Think critically about the code structure, functionality, and interdependencies. Do not make assumptions or hallucinate about any part of the code.

2. Research best practices for code documentation, including:
   - Documentation styles (e.g., JSDoc, Google Style, etc.)
   - File naming conventions
   - Appropriate locations for documentation within the codebase

3. Create a new branch for your documentation work. Use a descriptive name such as "add-documentation-for-[feature]".

4. Write clear and concise documentation in Markdown format, focusing on the aspects specified in the documentation focus. Include:
   - Overview of the code's purpose and functionality
   - Detailed explanations of complex algorithms or logic
   - Description of important functions, classes, and modules
   - Usage examples where appropriate
   - Any known limitations or edge cases

5. Create diagrams using Mermaid syntax to illustrate complex workflows, data structures, or system architectures. Embed these diagrams within your Markdown files.

6. Commit your changes to the new branch in small, logical batches. Each commit should have a clear and descriptive message explaining the documentation added or modified.

7. After completing the documentation, prepare a summary of your work, including:
   - An overview of the documentation you've created
   - Any challenges you encountered and how you addressed them
   - Suggestions for further improvements or areas that may need additional documentation

8. Ask for approval to push your changes and create a pull request.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<documentation_summary>
[Provide a concise summary of the documentation work completed]
</documentation_summary>

<challenges_and_solutions>
[List any challenges encountered and how they were addressed]
</challenges_and_solutions>

<suggestions>
[Offer any suggestions for further improvements or additional documentation needs]
</suggestions>

<approval_request>
I have completed the documentation as requested. Should I proceed with pushing the changes and creating a pull request?
</approval_request>

Remember, your output should only include the content within these tags. Do not include any of your thought process or additional commentary outside of these sections.
